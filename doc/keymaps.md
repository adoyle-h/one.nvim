# Default Keymaps

List basic keymaps for novices.
Press `<space>k` to see all keymaps in nvim.

## Keymaps Design Principles

- Prefixed `<leader>` to functions.
- Prefixed `<space>` to open/toggle window, and change mode.
- Prefixed `<M->` for shortcuts/toggle. Some keymaps can hold on.
- Prefixed `g` for goto/jump/search/lsp.
- Prefixed `[` or `]` for jump.
- Prefixed `<C-t>` for tabs.
- Prefixed `<C-w>` for windows.
- Normal characters for general skilled usages.
